\subsection*{Updates}

Everyone except Anthony has done the git tutorials, and done with their work for Sprint 0.  Anthony expects to do it this evening, so no one is stuck.

\subsection*{For Next Time}

We still don't know at this time what the project will be, so the main things to do will be to agree over Slack on a time to book the demo for Sprint 0, and to get all of our environments set up with IntelliJ.  The demo should get booked tonight, and everyone should have themselves set up for Tuesday.
